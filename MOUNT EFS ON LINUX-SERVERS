HOW TO MOUNT EFS ON LINUX-SERVERS

Step01 :- Create two EC2 instances with port 22 opened
      
                let the SG name for them is SG-port22-allowed

Step02 :- Create SG for EFS (EFS-SG) in which give reference of the SG of 22port
allowed 
 
               we’ll attach this SG to EFS allowing only the EC2 instances who have the
               SG of port 22 allowed (SG-port22-allowed)

Step03 :- Create EFS and attach the EFS-SG to the filesystem

Step04 :- run this command in each instance 

“sudo -i”
“yum -y install amazon-efs-utils”
“mkdir efs”

Step05 :- click attach button in efs and get the mount point.

               paste the 1st mount point in each instance.
               (sudo mount -t efs -o tls fs-08f5dceea205a13f9:/ efs)

               efs file system is mounted on /root/efs on both the instances.

               if you get the error for installing botocore, then search on browser for it 
               and follow the procedure and again run the mount command again.
